# AWS_ElasticMapReduce

A bootstrap action to install Anaconda3 and jupyter notebook on a Elastic Map 
Reduce (EMR) cluster of Amazon Web Service (AWS). The bootstrap has to be run 
as a boostrap to be executed on each node of the cluster. Run it once the 
cluster is ready is trick as you need to do it on each node manually.

In this repository, I also added the foxy-proxy config file:
    * old foxy (on Chrome): use the xml
    * new foxy (on Firefox): use the json
